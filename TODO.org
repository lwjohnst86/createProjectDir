   I would like to not have the sas macros and R functions in the
   directory. While it is modular, it takes up space + I need to
   refresh when I edit. Sooo if I add a git checkout to a specified
   tag, then if anyone wants to check if my code works, they can go
   to my website, use the tag which I had the macros in, and run the
   code based on the that tag. It is still modular, but less space
   and complexity involved (IMO).

** TODO Include StatRep package for SAS and knitr::spin for R for documenting.
